\arguments{
\item{y}{a vector, outcomes.}

\item{x}{a matrix, rows represent each observation, columns represent predictor.}

\item{intercept}{a logical value, "T" by default, the model has intercept.
if it's "F", the model doesn't have intercept.}

\item{y_hat}{a logical value, "T" by default, output the value of fitted y.
if it's "F", fitted value y will not be output.}

\item{SSE}{a logical value, "F" by default, SSE will not be output
if it's "T", output the value of SSE.}

\item{SSY}{a logical value, "F" by default, SSY will not be output
if it's "T", output the value of SSY.}

\item{r_square}{a logical value, "T" by default, output the value of r square.
if it's "F", r square will not be output.}

\item{adjusted_r_square}{a logical value, "F" by default, adjusted r square will not be output.
if it's "T", output the value of adjusted r square.}

\item{t_test}{a logical value, "F" by default, the results of t-test and p-values will not be output.
if it's "T", output the results of t-test and p-values.}

\item{f_test}{a logical value, "T" by default,output the results of f-test and p-values.
if it's "F", the results of t-test and f-values will not be output}

\item{hat_matrix}{a logical value, "F" by default, the results of hat matrix will not be output.
if it's "T", output the results hat matrix.}
